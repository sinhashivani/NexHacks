# proof

**proof** is a Chrome extension that adds real time intelligence directly on Polymarket market pages. It turns raw markets into informed decisions by surfacing correlation, context, and momentum where trades happen.

## Why We Built It

Polymarket traders operate without context. There is no native way to see which markets move together, how real world events affect a market, or where liquidity and activity are concentrating.

This forces manual research, external tools, and missed opportunity.

proof was built to close this gap.

## Features

### Related Markets
Surfaces correlated markets so traders can amplify or hedge positions without leaving the page.

### Trending Markets
Highlights where liquidity and activity are concentrating in real time.

### News
Adds real world context with relevant articles tied to each market.

## How It Works

proof detects the market you are viewing, fetches relevant data, and injects a lightweight overlay that updates as you navigate between markets.

## Key Technologies
